//! Purity-invariant enforcement (event-sourcing-completion Phase 8).
//!
//! `AGENTS.md`'s "Event-sourcing purity (INVARIANT)" rule: the raw keystroke
//! buffer is the immutable event log; displayed text is a pure projection.
//! No one-way flag/latch that, once set, prevents recomputation from raw.
//! `TypingContext` gaining a new persistent `bool` field is the textbook red
//! flag this invariant exists to catch — every past purity bug in this
//! codebase (sticky `temp_english`, the retired dual-engine's leftover
//! flags) started life as "just one more bool".
//!
//! ## Enforcement mechanism — not grep theater
//!
//! This is not a human tally that silently drifts from the real source: the
//! test below parses the ACTUAL `struct TypingContext { ... }` body out of
//! `pipeline/context.rs` (via `include_str!`, scoped to the real struct's
//! brace-delimited body, not a blind whole-file scan) and mechanically
//! counts `pub <name>: bool,` declarations within it. Any PR that adds,
//! removes, or renames a bool field changes this count and fails CI until
//! the change is deliberate — bump [`EXPECTED_BOOL_FIELD_COUNT`] AND add a
//! justification row to the table below in the SAME commit.
//!
//! See also `scripts/check-purity.ps1` — a companion deny-script that
//! enforces two orthogonal rules (temp_english_mode's assignment sites, and
//! a frozen count of `_mode: bool` fields workspace-wide) that this
//! single-struct, single-crate test cannot see.

/// Deleted 5 dead one-way bools left over from the retired dual-engine
/// (Permutation/Reconciliation/Retrofix stages, removed in an earlier
/// phase) — grep-verified ZERO production readers anywhere in the crate
/// (only ever written at `TypingContext::new()`/`clear()`, never consulted
/// by `ComposeStage` or any other pipeline stage):
/// `last_was_undo`, `just_undid`, `has_pending_marks`,
/// `had_successful_transform`, `used_permutation_result`. Three test files
/// outside this struct's own module referenced `last_was_undo` in
/// debug-print / tautological-fixture assertions only (no behavioral
/// coverage lost) and were updated alongside this deletion.
///
/// ## Field-justification table (every SURVIVING bool + why it is not a
/// purity violation)
///
/// | Field | Why it survives |
/// |---|---|
/// | `temp_english_mode` | The ONE legacy latch the purity invariant explicitly calls out (`AGENTS.md`) — but it is DERIVED, not one-way: `pipeline::stages::compose_stage`'s evidence-based un-latch (event-sourcing-completion Phase 2) re-probes `compose(&full_raw)` on every trigger-eligible keystroke while set, and clears it the instant the evidence says Vietnamese (`should_unlatch`). It is a transient CACHE of `compose()`'s own most recent verdict, re-evaluated from the full raw buffer, never a valve that blocks recomputation. |
/// | `showing_candidates` | UI presentation state for Stage 6 (Nôm dictionary lookup) — mirrors whether `candidates` is non-empty at the moment of the last lookup. Transient per-session UI bookkeeping, not a decision about how to interpret raw keystrokes. |
/// | `learning_enabled` | A session-level USER SETTING (mirrors `Settings::learning_enabled`), not something derived from raw at all — same category as any other config-derived field on `ComposeOpts` (e.g. `tone_enabled`). Configuration is data, not a re-derivation target. |
///
/// ## Other legitimate non-raw-derived state (outside `TypingContext`, for
/// completeness — these are NOT counted here, but exist for the same
/// structural reason `learning_enabled` does: they are DATA, not decisions)
///
/// - **P4's `Keyboard::toggle_map`** (`buttre_core::keyboard::Keyboard`) —
///   a map of USER EVENTS (deliberate toggle actions), not an inference
///   over raw. The toggle itself IS part of the event log in spirit (a
///   user-initiated projection override); it is folded into `compose_window`
///   by parity every recompute, never mutating composed text outside the
///   normal diff path.
/// - **P5's `LearningStore` (overlay + prefs)** (`buttre_core::state::learning`)
///   — CROSS-SESSION data (what the user has taught the engine over time),
///   entering `compose()` as `Arc` snapshots inside `ComposeOpts`, never as
///   a global or a hidden side channel. `compose()` stays pure: same
///   raw + same opts (incl. the snapshot) always yields the same result.
