//! Fallback step — undo / toggle / English-fallback derived from raw key counts.
//!
//! ## Design: stateless from raw keys
//!
//! All decisions are derived by counting repeated keys in `raw`.  No history
//! flags, no transform records.
//!
//! ## Rules (mirroring stage4/stage8 behaviour)
//!
//! ### Transform undo / toggle
//!
//! A transform mark (`aa→â`, `aw→ă`, `dd→đ`, etc.) is undone when the trigger
//! key is typed **one extra time** beyond what the transform consumes.
//!
//! Pattern: the *last* 2-char rule in the buffer was applied (2 same keys → 1
//! result), and now a *third* identical key arrives.
//!
//! Rule: if the last two identical-and-transform-related chars in raw are
//! followed immediately by a third identical char → output the two literal keys
//! and set `temp_english = true`.
//!
//! Example: `aaa` → "aa" (literal), `aww` → "aw" (literal).
//!
//! ### Tone undo / toggle
//!
//! A tone key typed twice removes the tone and yields a literal tone key suffix.
//! Example: `ass` → "as" (literal), `a11` → "a1" (raw undo, current engine).
//!
//! **Partial undo (transform-preserving):** when the base before the tone key
//! contains transform triggers (e.g. `a611`: `a6` → `â`, then `11` undo pair),
//! the undo strips ONLY the tone and keeps the diacritic transform.  The
//! transformed vowel is recomputed by running the segment + transform steps on
//! the base portion without any tone.
//!
//!   - `a611` → `â1`  (â preserved, tone removed, literal `1` appended)
//!   - `a822` → `ă2`  (ă preserved)
//!   - `u733` → `ư3`  (ư preserved)
//!   - `o744` → `ơ4`  (ơ preserved)
//!   - `u7o711` → `ươ1`  (compound transform preserved)
//!
//! ### Same-tone repress (coda-interleaved undo)
//!
//! When the user presses a tone key that is already applied to the current
//! syllable (even with a coda consonant between the original tone key and the
//! re-press), this is an undo: strip the tone from the composed result and
//! append the literal tone key.  Matches Unikey `tempVietOff` behaviour.
//!
//!   - `vie65t5` → `viêt5`  (strip dot tone from việt, keep ê transform, literal 5)
//!
//! ### Multi-level toggle (Unikey standard)
//!
//! After a tone-undo pair, `temp_english` mode engages and subsequent same-key
//! taps are literal (no re-apply).  This matches Unikey behaviour — it is NOT
//! a missing feature, NOT a bug.  See: `a111` → `a11`, `a222` → `a22`.
//!
//! ### English fallback
//!
//! After an undo resolves to a literal key sequence with no valid Vietnamese
//! transforms remaining, `temp_english = true` signals the executor to pass
//! subsequent input through (Phase 4 only — this module just sets the flag).
//!
//! ### Non-adjacent transform undo (Phase 4)
//!
//! Extends the retype-to-undo reflex to NON-ADJACENT marks (see
//! `segment::TransformMark::non_adjacent`) — the escape hatch for an accepted
//! attested collision (`"cana"` → `"cân"`; retype `a` → literal `"cana"`,
//! English latched). Unlike the adjacent toggles above, a non-adjacent mark's
//! trigger key is not necessarily the syllable's last RAW character at the
//! moment it fires (`"dodong"`'s đ fires on the 3rd raw char, well before the
//! word ends) — so "retype to undo" only makes sense as an IMMEDIATE reflex:
//! the very next keystroke after the firing one. `check_nonadjacent_transform_toggle`
//! enforces this precisely (see its doc).
//!
//! ## Ordering contract
//!
//! Runs strictly AFTER `check_tone_toggle` and `check_transform_toggle` in
//! `check_fallback` below. Adjacent toggles keep priority: `"aaa"` → `"aa"`
//! must always resolve via `check_transform_toggle`'s tail-triple match and
//! must never reach this check (verified by a regression test — adjacent
//! toggle claims `"aaa"`/`"canaa"`-shaped tails before this function ever
//! runs). This check runs BEFORE `segment`/`transform`/`assemble` — it is
//! step 1 of `compose_internal`, same as the other two toggles.
//!
//! ## Equivalence note (red-team AD-minor)
//!
//! On undo, the output is the LITERAL prefix raw keys, always — never a
//! recomposed form. Unlike `check_transform_toggle` above (which calls
//! `apply_transforms_only` to PRESERVE any earlier, unrelated completed
//! transform in the prefix — e.g. `"ddaaa"` → `"đaa"`, not `"ddaa"`), this
//! check does NOT recompose the prefix when reverting: an earlier, unrelated
//! transform that had already fired within the SAME prefix would also revert
//! to its literal keys for this one keystroke, rather than surviving in
//! composed form.
//!
//! This simplification is safe ONLY because `compose()` is a pure, stateless
//! recompute: the very next keystroke reprocesses the ENTIRE buffer from
//! scratch, so an independent earlier transform re-fires exactly as it would
//! typing from a cold start — there is no stale state for it to have been
//! lost FROM. It also is not a new class of transient loss this check
//! introduces: `compose_internal`'s own step 6 (English fallback,
//! `could_be_vietnamese`) already reverts an ENTIRE word — including any
//! earlier adjacent transforms — to literal `raw.iter().collect()` whenever
//! the whole composed result fails to look Vietnamese, on exactly the same
//! "self-heals next keystroke" assumption. `"dodongd"`-shaped inputs (an
//! earlier non-adjacent mark, followed later by an unrelated retype) do NOT
//! actually reach this code path in practice — the immediacy contract
//! (below) requires the retyped key to equal the raw key immediately
//! preceding it, which is never true once other keys have been typed in
//! between (that shape is exactly what `"vieteje"`'s "must NOT undo" case
//! demonstrates) — so this note documents the underlying design principle
//! for the general case, not a claim that `"dodongd"` itself exercises it.

/// Every detector this predicate goes through is driven entirely by the

/// in `check_transform_toggle`, and the retype-immediacy check in
/// `check_nonadjacent_transform_toggle`) — never a hardcoded key list.
///
/// ## Why delegation, not a second formula
///
/// An earlier proposal collapsed multi-step undo/redo to a single rule —
/// "even trailing run of the same key ⇒ undo, odd ⇒ the mark stays on" — and
/// red-teamed it: `vie65t5`'s trailing run of `'5'` is exactly 1 (odd), yet
/// the syllable STILL undoes, via the separate same-tone-repress-after-coda
/// path (`check_tone_toggle`'s Path 2), not trailing parity. One formula
/// cannot express both paths at once. Delegating to the SAME functions
/// [`check_fallback`] already dispatches through — rather than re-deriving
/// the rule a second time — is what guarantees this predicate reproduces
/// every existing detector outcome EXACTLY, by construction, not by
/// coincidence: `a611`, `seess`, `vie65t5`, `aaa`, and `dessign`'s undo point
/// (`"dess"`) are all pinned by the unit tests below.
///
/// ## Consumer (P2)
///
/// This is the shared LAST-EVENT predicate `pipeline::stages::compose_stage`'s
/// evidence-based un-latch condition (d) consumes via
/// `compose::is_last_event_undo`: "is the word, as typed so far, sitting in a
/// just-undone state" (see `plan.md`'s Combined Contract — "(d) is a
/// LAST-EVENT parity fold sharing P6's rule"). This module defines and pins
/// the predicate only; deciding what to DO with an undone state (un-latch,
