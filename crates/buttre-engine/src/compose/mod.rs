//! Compose engine — pure recompute-from-raw core (Phase 3).
//!
//! ## Design
//!
//! One call to [`compose`] rebuilds the entire syllable from the raw key buffer.
//! No hidden state, no history flags. Each sub-module owns one pipeline step:
//!
//! | Step | Module | What it does |
//! |------|--------|-------------|
//! | Segment | [`segment`] | Raw keys → (base, transform marks, tone marks) |
//! | Transform | [`transform`] | Apply diacritic marks to base, validation-gated |
//! | Assemble | [`assemble`] | Place + apply tone mark onto nucleus |
//! | Fallback | [`fallback`] | Undo / toggle / English-fallback from key counts |
//!
//! ## Wiring
//!
//! [`compose`] is a **pure** function (no hidden state, no I/O), but it is the
//! live production core: `pipeline::stages::compose_stage` calls it on every
//! keystroke, replacing the former incremental transform/tone/permutation
//! stages. Purity is what lets the recompute-from-raw model work — each
//! keystroke rebuilds the syllable from the raw buffer with no accumulated
//! inter-stage state.

/// `closed` is the word-boundary flag from [`compose_closed`]. When `true`,

/// a closed word expects no further keystrokes, so a shape-only match whose
/// tone never arrived has no excuse left to survive on ("nhat6" → "nhât"
/// restores its literal raw). When the composed text ALREADY carries a tone,
/// shape attestation still suffices at the boundary: the "tone hasn't
/// arrived yet" rationale is moot, and clamping to exact attestation there
/// rejected deliberately-typed informal words ("d9ech56" → "đệch", shape
/// attested via "đếch") while the adjacent key order ("d9e6ch5", marks
/// unflagged) committed the same word — commit results must not depend on
/// key order. The demote path taken when the gate fails is byte-identical
/// to the open-projection gate's (`compose_internal` recurses with
/// `allow_nonadjacent=false`, unaffected by `closed`).
///
/// ## Trigger classification (P6 gate hardening)
///
/// ASCII-digit triggers relax to a SHAPE match (`is_shape_attested`, any
/// tone): the tone key often arrives AFTER the digit mark (`nhat61`), so the
/// exact tone is not yet known when the gate must decide, and a real VNI
/// digit trigger cannot occur inside an English word anyway. EVERYTHING ELSE
/// — Telex-style alphabetic triggers AND any non-alphabetic, non-digit
/// trigger (punctuation, in a hypothetical custom config) — requires an EXACT
/// match (`is_attested`, whatever tone `text` currently carries): a real
/// Telex mark key is also a base letter or a tone key, so a false alphabetic
/// match would already have to look like a real Vietnamese word, and a
/// punctuation trigger has no VNI-style "tone hasn't arrived yet" excuse for
/// relaxing to shape.
///
/// Before this hardening, the classification was inverted — `is_alphabetic()
/// → exact, else → shape` — which correctly handled Telex (alphabetic) and
/// VNI (digit) but wrongly RELAXED any non-digit, non-alphabetic trigger
/// (e.g. a punctuation trigger in a custom config) to shape-attestation too.
/// Classifying on `is_ascii_digit()` instead closes that gap while leaving
/// Telex and VNI byte-identical (Telex triggers are never digits; VNI
/// triggers are always digits).
///
/// ## Intrinsic trade-off (delayed-mark Telex live feedback)
///
/// The exact-match requirement for non-digit triggers means a Telex
/// delayed/non-adjacent mark whose toneless form is unattested does NOT show
/// its diacritic until the tone key is typed: `viete` composes to literal
/// `viete` at that frame (bare `viêt` is not a word), then `+j` recomputes to
/// `việt`. The FINAL output is always correct; only the intermediate frame of
/// the less-common delayed-mark style defers feedback. This cannot be
/// "fixed" by relaxing Telex to shape-attestation — `viete→viêt` and
/// `data→dât` are the identical non-adjacent operation, and `dât`'s shape is
/// attested (via `dật`/`dất`), so shape-relaxing Telex would reopen the very
/// `data→dât` bug this gate exists to close. VNI escapes the trade-off only
/// because its digit trigger cannot occur inside an English word.
///
/// ## Assumption
///
/// Relies on each method being single-trigger-kind (Telex: all alphabetic;
/// VNI: all digit). A hypothetical custom config mixing digit and non-digit
/// triggers would relax a co-occurring non-digit mark to the shape check. No
/// shipped preset does this.
///
/// ## Overlay (event-sourcing-completion Phase 5)
///
/// The EXACT-match branch consults `opts.user_attested` through
/// [`is_attested_overlay`] — the single shared consult point P2's
/// evidence-based un-latch probe (`pipeline::stages::compose_stage::
/// should_unlatch`) also uses, so both the word-boundary closed gate and
/// the un-latch probe agree on what counts as attested. The SHAPE-relaxed
/// branch (digit triggers, open projection only) is deliberately NOT
/// overlay-aware: overlay entries are individual exact syllables (a
/// specific onset/nucleus/coda/TONE tuple), not shape families, so
/// widening a shape check to the overlay would double-relax an
/// already-permissive path for no corresponding user signal.
