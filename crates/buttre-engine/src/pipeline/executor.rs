//! Pipeline Executor — orchestrates the 7-stage processing pipeline (Phase 4+).
//!
//! ## 7-Stage Architecture
//!
//! | # | Stage | Responsibility |
//! |---|-------|----------------|
//! | 1 | Normalization | Normalize input, populate char_buffer |
//! | 2 | Gatekeeper | Route non-Vietnamese / temp-English passthrough |
//! | 3 | Compose | Recompute-from-raw: segment → transform → tone → fallback |
//! | 4 | Orthography | Normalize Unicode form |
//! | 5 | Learning | Track patterns (no-op until Phase 5) |
//! | 6 | Lookup | Dictionary lookup (Nôm candidates) |
//! | 7 | Output | Diff last_output → syllable_buffer → emit actions |
//!
//! The former dual-engine (Transform + Tone + Permutation + Reconciliation + Retrofix)
//! has been retired.  All composition logic lives in `crates/buttre-engine/src/compose/`
//! and is invoked by `ComposeStage` as a single recompute-from-raw step.
