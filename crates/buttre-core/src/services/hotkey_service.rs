//! Hotkey Service - Global hotkey management with event bus integration
//!
//! **Tests**: Integration tests for this module are located in `crates/buttre-core/tests/service_hotkey_tests.rs`.
//!
//! This service wraps the ButtreHotkeyManager and integrates it with the event bus,
//! automatically publishing hotkey events when keys are pressed.

///
/// let bus = create_event_bus();
/// let service = HotkeyService::new(bus.clone())?;

/// // In your event loop:
/// service.poll(); // This will publish HotkeyPressed events
