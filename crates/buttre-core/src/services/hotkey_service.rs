//! Hotkey Service - Global hotkey management with event bus integration
//!
//! **Tests**: Integration tests for this module are located in `crates/buttre-core/tests/service_hotkey_tests.rs`.
//!
//! This service wraps the ButtreHotkeyManager and integrates it with the event bus,
//! automatically publishing hotkey events when keys are pressed.
