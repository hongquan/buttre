## Project
buttre — Cross-platform Vietnamese input method engine (Rust, TSF/IBus/macOS IMKit).

## Tooling
- Build: `cargo build --release`
- Test:  `cargo test` / `cargo test --package buttre-engine`
- Lint:  `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features`
- Fmt:   `cargo fmt`

## Safety Rules
- NEVER commit secrets (.env, API keys, credentials)
- NEVER force-push to main/master without explicit user confirmation
- NEVER use `unwrap()` / `expect()` / `panic!()` in library code — use `Result`/`Option`/`?`
- NEVER ignore failing tests to make CI green
- NEVER use `unsafe` in `buttre-engine` or `buttre-core`; document every `unsafe` block in `buttre-platform` with `// SAFETY:` comments

## Vietnamese Input Rules (engine changes)
When changing how Vietnamese is typed (Telex/VNI rules, tone placement, transforms, fallback, validation):
- **Event-sourcing purity (INVARIANT)** — the raw keystroke buffer is the immutable event log; displayed text is a pure projection (`compose(raw)`). NEVER introduce a one-way decision: no flag/latch that, once set, prevents recomputation from raw; no accumulated inter-stage state. A decision policy must be RE-EVALUATED from full raw each keystroke — order-dependent folds over the log are fine (statelessness is not required; *derivability* is). New persistent fields on `TypingContext` are a review red flag: if it can be derived from raw, derive it. History: every major bug class (sticky `temp_english`, pre-gate heuristic guards, the retired dual-engine) was a one-way decision. `temp_english_mode` is the last legacy latch, migrated to evidence-based re-derivation in event-sourcing-completion Phase 2 (`pipeline::stages::compose_stage::should_unlatch`).
  - **Enforcement (event-sourcing-completion Phase 8):** `crates/buttre-engine/tests/purity_audit.rs` freezes `TypingContext`'s `bool` field count (any addition/removal fails until justified + the count is bumped in the same commit — the file's doc comment carries the field-justification table) and `scripts/check-purity.ps1` (`pwsh ./scripts/check-purity.ps1`) enforces `temp_english_mode`'s assignment-site allowlist plus a frozen `_mode: bool` baseline workspace-wide. Run both after any change touching `TypingContext` or adding a new `bool`/`_mode` field.
- **Flow through the 7-stage pipeline** — implement the change in the stage that owns it (`crates/buttre-engine/src/pipeline/` + `compose/`). Do NOT add side channels or platform-layer special cases. See [docs/PIPELINE_ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/PIPELINE_ARCHITECTURE.md).
- **Write a GENERAL algorithm**, config-driven from the rule/tone tables — never hardcode a single word, syllable, or keystroke string. If you catch yourself matching a literal like `"won"` or `"nghieng"`, generalize it (e.g. via phonology validity, vowel-group counting, coda tables).
- **Hardcoding is a last resort** — only when a general solution is genuinely impossible, and then it MUST carry a `// HARDCODE:` comment explaining why no general rule works and what would remove it.
- **Prefer the phonology tables** in `crates/buttre-engine/src/pipeline/validation.rs` (onsets/nuclei/codas/combinations) as the source of truth for "is this valid Vietnamese". Extend the tables rather than special-casing in logic.
- **Cover every method** — a rule change must be validated against Telex and VNI (and VIQR/Nôm where implemented), with golden snapshots regenerated and reviewed (`cargo run -p buttre-core --example gen_golden`; diff must contain only intended changes). NOTE: the VIQR preset is intentionally absent (descoped — its punctuation triggers make the attested-collision class fire at every sentence end); read the descoped design record in `.agents/` before adding it.

## Release Checklist
When bumping the version (in `Cargo.toml` files or during a release):
1. Update the version string in the **"Hướng dẫn"** (help dialog) screen:
   - File: `crates/buttre-platform/src/shared/ui/help_dialog.rs`
   - Line: the `"Phiên bản: X.Y.Z"` entry inside the `message` string literal
2. Update `CHANGELOG.md` with the new version section
3. Confirm all workspace crates share the same version
